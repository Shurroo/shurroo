Modules
-------

This directory contains the Ansible Modules needed by Shurroo. The Shurroo bootstrap scripts copy these modules once the Ansible installation is complete.


Caveats
-------
The `plist.py` module will be replaced with the `PListNode.py` module once this is completed. The `plist.py` module does not work successfully with complex `plist` file structures.
